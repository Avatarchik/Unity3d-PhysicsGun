# Unity3d Gravity Gun Sample
The goal of this sample is to be an implementation of a "Gravity Gun", that mimics the exact behavior as the Gravity Gun in Half-Life 2 / Garry's Mod.

Some guy (Pzula) already did this apparently in Unity3d - I have tried to reach out to him, but sadly no response yet.

Originally the "GravityGun" script in this repo, is based on this script: https://pastebin.com/w1G8m3dH
